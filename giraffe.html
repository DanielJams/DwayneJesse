                           <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
         <p>The South African giraffe (G. c. giraffa) is found in northern South Africa, southern Botswana, northern Botswana and southwestern Mozambique.[1][38][39] It has a tawny background colour marked with dark, somewhat rounded patches "with some fine projections". The spots extend down the legs, growing smaller as they do. The median lump of males is relatively small.[27]: 52  A maximum of 31,500 are estimated to remain in the wild,[1] and around 45 are living in zoos.[2</p>
                           <p> <strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
    <p>You will find the giraffe at pen E26, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
